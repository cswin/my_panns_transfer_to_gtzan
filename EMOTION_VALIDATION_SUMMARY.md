# Emotion Model Validation Summary

## Data Splitting Strategy

### Train/Validation Ratio
- **70% training / 30% validation** split by audio files
- Changed from default 80/20 to 70/30 as requested
- **Audio-based splitting**: Ensures no data leakage between train/validation sets

### Data Leakage Prevention
- **Problem**: Each 6-second audio clip is split into 6 segments of 1 second each
- **Risk**: Random segment-based splitting could put segments from same audio in both train/val
- **Solution**: Split by unique audio files first, then assign all segments from same file to same split

### Expected Numbers
- Total: 1,213 audio files → 7,278 segments (1,213 × 6)
- Training: ~849 audio files → ~5,094 segments (70%)
- Validation: ~364 audio files → ~2,184 segments (30%)

## Evaluation Metrics

### Dual-Level Evaluation
The system now computes metrics at two levels:

#### 1. Segment-Level Metrics
- Evaluates each 1-second segment independently
- Higher sample count (~2,184 validation segments)
- Shows model performance on individual segments

#### 2. Audio-Level Metrics (Primary)
- Aggregates segment predictions by averaging within each audio file
- Lower sample count (~364 validation audio files)
- **More meaningful for real-world application**
- Prevents segment-level noise from dominating evaluation

### Metrics Computed
For both Valence and Arousal:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Pearson Correlation**
- **Spearman Correlation**
- **R-squared (R²)**

### Aggregation Method
For audio-level metrics:
1. Group all segments by base audio filename
2. Average predictions across segments for each audio file
3. Use ground truth labels (same for all segments from same audio)
4. Compute metrics on audio-level predictions vs targets

## Training Integration

### Logging During Training
- **Primary metrics**: Audio-level MAE, RMSE, Pearson correlation
- **Secondary metrics**: Segment-level metrics for comparison
- Validation runs every 200 iterations

### Model Selection
- Use audio-level metrics for model selection and early stopping
- Audio-level Pearson correlation is good indicator of model quality
- Audio-level MAE provides interpretable error measure

## Validation Scripts

### test_data_split.py
- Verifies no data leakage between train/validation
- Confirms proper audio-based splitting
- Shows segment distribution per audio file

### test_emotion_evaluation.py
- Tests the dual-level evaluation system
- Verifies both segment and audio metrics are computed
- Uses mock model to test evaluation pipeline

## Usage Example

```python
# During training
evaluator = EmotionEvaluator(model)
statistics = evaluator.evaluate(validate_loader)

# Primary metrics for model selection
audio_mae = statistics['audio_mean_mae']
audio_pearson = statistics['audio_mean_pearson']

# Detailed evaluation
evaluator.print_evaluation(statistics)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No Data Leakage**: Audio-based splitting prevents overfitting
2. **Realistic Evaluation**: Audio-level metrics reflect real-world performance
3. **Comprehensive**: Both segment and audio metrics available
4. **Proper Aggregation**: Segments from same audio properly combined
5. **Standard Split**: 70/30 ratio as commonly used in research
