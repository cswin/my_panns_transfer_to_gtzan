### Architecture Analysis

#### Model Structure
```
Input → Visual System → Shared Embedding (512d)
                    ↓
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ Valence Path │ → 256d → **128d** → 1d (output)
              └─────────────┘
                    ↓
              ┌─────────────┐  
              │ Arousal Path │ → 256d → **128d** → 1d (output)
              └─────────────┘
```

#### Steering Target Layers
- **Conv3**: `from_affective_valence_128d_to_visual_system_base_conv_block3`

### Signal Extraction Process

#### 25-Bin Fine Categorization (Initial Approach)
- **Valence**: 5 levels (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive)
- **Arousal**: 5 levels (very weak, weak, moderate, strong, very strong)
- **Total**: 25 categories with poor sample distribution (1-52 samples each)
- **Coverage**: ~95% of validation samples
- **Performance**: Poor (-0.060 valence, +0.009 arousal)

#### 9-Bin Coarse Categorization (Optimal Approach)
- **Valence**: negative, neutral, positive (thresholds: -0.3, 0.3)
- **Arousal**: weak, moderate, strong (thresholds: -0.3, 0.3)
- **Total**: 9 categories with better sample distribution (16-301 samples each)
- **Coverage**: 99.5% of validation samples
- **Performance**: Optimal (+0.0004 valence, +0.014 arousal)

#### Signal Generation
1. **Group samples** by emotion category
2. **Extract activations** from valence/arousal 128d layers
3. **Average across samples** in each category
4. **Validate signal separation** (correlations -0.10 to +0.16)

## Critical Discoveries

### 1. **Single-Pathway Superiority**
- **Valence-only steering** significantly outperforms dual-pathway steering
- **Arousal-only steering** is counterproductive and hurts performance
- **Focused targeting** reduces interference between pathways

### 2. **Layer Targeting Equivalence**
- **Conv3 and conv4** produce identical steering effects
- **No layer-specific control** - steering affects entire valence pathway
- **Robust mechanism** - not sensitive to specific layer choice

### 3. **Signal Quality Matters**
- **9-bin coarse categorization** with better sample distribution (16-301 samples) outperforms 25-bin fine categorization (1-52 samples)
- **Sample distribution** is more critical than categorization granularity
- **Proper signal separation** (correlations -0.10 to +0.16) is crucial
- **Averaging across samples** provides reliable steering signals

### 4. **Strength Sensitivity**
- **Optimal range**: 0.1-2.0 strength
- **Peak performance**: 2.0 strength (+0.014 arousal improvement)
- **Catastrophic degradation**: >5.0 strength (model "explodes")

## Implementation Guidelines

### Production Configuration
```python
# Optimal steering configuration
steering_config = {
    'approach': 'valence_conv4_only',
    'strength': 1.5,  # Balanced performance
    'binning': '9bin_coarse',
    'min_samples': 15,
    'target_layers': ['conv4'],  # or conv3 - identical results
    'coverage': 99.5
}
```

### Signal Generation Process
1. **Load emotion dataset** and categorize into 9 bins
2. **Extract valence 128d activations** for each category
3. **Average activations** across samples in each category
4. **Validate signal separation** (ensure correlations < 0.9)
5. **Save steering signals** in JSON format

### Application Process
1. **Load steering signals** for target emotion category
2. **Apply valence signal** to conv4 layer only
3. **Use strength 1.5-2.0** for optimal performance

### 2. **Target Valence Pathway Only**
- Avoid arousal steering (counterproductive)
- Focus on valence pathway for best results
- Single-pathway reduces interference

### 3. **Use Conservative Strength Range**
- **Production**: 1.0-1.5 strength
